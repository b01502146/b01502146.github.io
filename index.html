        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This site contains the index page(Home page,) the Game page, where the game "Fly Fly Little Bird" is presented, and the Reference Page, where all resources of knowledge and material used to build this website is acknowledged. </p>
        <p>It is the second homework assignment of the Computer Science class I took in the academic year of 2015. The assignment has been challenging mostly due to my unfamiliarity with coding, but the result was satisfying. Also I have learned alot about HTML, CSS, and Javascript from this. I wish to further my learning in programming by using the website w3schools.com where I could gain a certificate in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This has been a very enjoyable class. </p>
